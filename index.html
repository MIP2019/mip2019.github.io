With the increasing prevalence of portable devices and the popularity of community Question Answering (cQA) sites, users can seamlessly post and answer massive questions. To effectively organize the information for precise recommendation and easy searching, these platforms require users to select topics for their raised questions. However, due to the limited experience, certain users fail to select appropriate topics for their questions. Thereby, automatic question tagging becomes an urgent and vital problem for the cQA sites, yet it is non-trivial due to the following challenges. On the one hand, abundant and meaningful topics are available yet not utilized in the cQA sites, but how to model and tag them to relevant questions is a highly challenging problem. On the other hand, related topics in the cQA sites may be organized into a directed acyclic graph. In light of this, how to exploit relations among topics to enhance their representations is critical. To settle these challenges, in this paper, we devise a graph-guided topic ranking model to tag questions in the cQA sites appropriately. In particular, we first design a topic information fusion module to learn the topic representation by jointly considering the name and description of the topic. Afterwards, regarding the special structure of topics, we propose an information propagation module to enhance the topic representation. As the comprehension of questions plays a vital role in question tagging, we design a multi-level context modeling based question encoder to obtain the enhanced question representation. Moreover, we introduce an interaction module to extract topic-aware question information, and capture the interactive information between questions and topics. Finally, we utilize the interactive information to estimate the ranking scores for
topics. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors.
