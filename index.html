<p>Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new noninvasive imaging technique used in the medical field. OCT can be described as an ultrasonic scan using light instead of sound. It measures the time delay and amplitude of backscattered light. The aim of the OCT technology is to perform a real-time, in vivo, optic biopsy, with direct visualization of the histological structure of the human tissues.
