<b>1. Dataset Description </b>
<br> 
<p style=text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;> 
 Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the major causes of vision loss even blindness in adults suffering from diabetes. With the large number of retina-disease patients, there is a urgent need for automatic recognition of retinal diseases. The wide-field optical coherence tomography angiography (WF-OCTA) is non-invasive imaging technique and convenient to diagnosis diabetic retinopathy. OCTA has the potential efficacy in the analysis of common ophthalmologic diseases, such as the clinical capability of delineating pathology information and obtaining the high-resolution fundus vessel. A new retinal OCT-Angiography diabetic retinopathy dataset(ROAD) is imaged by OCTA. The new ROAD dataset includes 1200 no DR images, 1440 DR images and 1440 ground truth of segmentation for DR images. The ROAD dataset consists of three grades: no DR, mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The ground truth of lesion region for DR images in ROAD has also been labeled by professional ophthalmologists. The new DR dataset will be helpful for development of the early detection of DR field and the future researches.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software.
