<b>1. Dataset Description </b>
<br> 
<p style=text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;> 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography has drawn much attention in the medical imaging field. We collect a new OCT mice eye (OCT-ME) database, which will be publicly released soon. A total of 50 images taken from mice in vivo are recorded by OCT. The size of each image is 2048*2048 pixels. The eye of mouse generally contains four organs, such as retina, lens, iris and cornea. Due to the limitation of page space and network bandwidth, we resize the images as 512*512 for view. As shown in Fig.1, we can see that the background and foreground of some organs are low-contrast. 
<br>This dataset will be soon released publicly. The ground-truth samples were manually made by our experts, which are aided with our self-developed software. This software is a specialized tool to make the ground truth from original samples under complex scene.
